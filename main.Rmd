# When "by design" becomes an unsuspecting feature

### Or when ignorance is not bliss

???
  
Contrary to the common believe that the phase "Ignorance is bliss" means "you will be more comfortable if you don't know something"
When it comes to R syntax you will be much better off if you are fully aware of this fundamental language design decision.

### Left is the state of disbelief when you may first encounter recycling or vectorization
### Right may represent the state of disbelief when you first learn that this was done by design
### Center may well be the state of belief after you learn about this features and start using them productively

# Creative [computer language] design needs to be communicated

???
  
### Communicated is an euphemism for the more proper "taught".
### The reason is because we are not born in communities where we learn to use computer languages since we are born like human languages
