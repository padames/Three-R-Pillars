#What about coercion?

Coercion emerges in R when **_assigning_** values to its data structures

Two cases of interest arise:

???
#### With R's basic data types and data structures under our belt we are in a position to tackle coercion
#### Here are two examples of when it is used to decide how data is put into data structure

1. Input data do not meet the requirements of the data structure

2. Data structure coercion

##When input data do not meet the requirements of the data structure

```
--
```{r, define-a-vector-1-2, echo=c(2), highlight.output=T}

devtools::install_github("hadley/emo")
```
####`r emo::ji("+1")` `doubles` remain `doubles` after assignment 

---

##When input data do not meet the requirements of the data structure

--
- Now let's try with heterogeneous input...

```{r, define-a-vector2, error=TRUE, tidy.opts = list(blank = T, width.cutoff = 90)}
(morning_temperatures <- c(Mon=16, Tue=18, Wed="15C"))

morning_temperatures <- c(Mon=16, Tue=18, Wed="15C")

```

.presenter-notes-small[ 

We will use a vector constructor to append a vector to a list.

The result could be a vector or a list.

The coercion from vector into list is not about the types of the individual elements. They are all of the same type, "character".

It's about chosing a more general data structure: a list can contain a vector but not the other way around!

Let's remember or basic R data structures: they also have a hierarchy!

- R reuses your input to minimise waste.

- The _waste_ might be the cognitive overload from having to write large, repetitive data structures   

--

- This is a **language design** decision

##Matrix construction 101

- To build a matrix like this:

![:scale 30%](matrix.png)


- In R we create a matrix with the built-in function `matrix()`:

--

```{r matrix-constructor, echo=T, tidy=T, highlight.output=T}
matrix(c(5, -1, 3, 0, -4, 1), ncol = 3, nrow = 2, byrow = T)
```

##Matrix construction 101

- By default `matrix()` will use the vector to fill in the matrix in **column order**:

--

```{r matrix-constructor-column-order, echo=T, tidy=T, highlight.output=T}
matrix(c(5, -1, 3, 0, -4, 1), ncol = 3, nrow = 2)
```

--

- This is a _different_ matrix from the one we wanted:

###The "waste" minimization example

--

```{r mask-generation, highlight.output=T, tidy=T}
set.seed(673912) # arbitrary number for reproducible results
(values <- sample.int(n = 99, size = 16, replace = TRUE))
```
--

```{r populate-matrix-random-numbers, echo=c(3), tidy=T, highlight.output=TRUE}
set.seed(673912) # arbitrary number for reproducible results
values <- sample.int(n = 99, size = 16, replace = TRUE)
(m <- matrix(values, nrow = 4))
```

--

```{r populate-matrix-create-mask, echo=c(4), tidy=T, highlight.output=TRUE}
set.seed(673912) # arbitrary number for reproducible results
values <- sample.int(n = 99, size = 16, replace = TRUE)
m <- matrix(values, nrow = 4)
( zero_to_4th_row <- c(1,1,1,0) )
```

--

```{r populate-matrix-apply-mask, echo=c(5), tidy=T, highlight.output=TRUE}
set.seed(673912) # arbitrary number for reproducible results
values <- sample.int(n = 99, size = 16, replace = TRUE)
m <- matrix(values, nrow = 4)
zero_to_4th_row <- c(1,1,1,0)
m * zero_to_4th_row        # [m]_4x4 x [mask]_4x1 = ??
```

This example describes why recycling suits vectorized operations and data structures.

How did this work?

Matrix multiplication does not work like that!

#Vector subsetting

- R is a vectorized language. There are no scalars.
--

```{r vectorized, highlight.output=TRUE}
A <- 1
is.vector(A)
```
--
- Subsetting by position:

```{r subset-by-position-setup-pos, highlight.output=TRUE}
(X <- c(5, -1, 3, 0, -4, 1))   # a vector with 6 elements
```
--
```{r subset-by-position, highlight.output=TRUE, echo=c(2)}
X <- c(5, -1, 3, 0, -4, 1)
X[1]     # In R, positions in a vector start at 1
```

--
```{r subset-by-position-sequence, highlight.output=TRUE, echo=c(2)}
X <- c(5, -1, 3, 0, -4, 1)
X[1:3]     # the first three elements
```
--
```{r subset-by-position-vector-of-positions, highlight.output=TRUE, echo=c(2)}
X <- c(5, -1, 3, 0, -4, 1)
X[c(1,3,6)]     # the first, third, and sixth elements
```

#Vector subsetting (cont.)

- Subsetting by excluding positions:

--

```{r subset-by-position-excluding-pos-setup, highlight.output=TRUE, echo=T}
(X <- c(5, -1, 3, 0, -4, 1))
```

--

```{r subset-by-position-excluding-pos, highlight.output=TRUE, echo=c(2)}
X <- c(5, -1, 3, 0, -4, 1)
X[-1]     # all but the first
```

--

```{r subset-by-position-excluding-pos-vector, highlight.output=TRUE, echo=c(2)}
X <- c(5, -1, 3, 0, -4, 1)
X[c(-1,-6)]     # all but the first and last
```

#Vector subsetting

- Subsetting by logical masks:

```{r subset-by-position-setup-logical-mask, highlight.output=TRUE}
(X <- c(5, -1, 3, 0, -4, 1))   # a vector with 6 elements
```

--

```{r subset-by-logical-mask-creation, highlight.output=TRUE, echo=c(2)}
X <- c(5, -1, 3, 0, -4, 1)
( is_positive <- c( X > 0 ) )
```
--

```{r subset-by-logical-mask, highlight.output=TRUE, echo=c(3)}
X <- c(5, -1, 3, 0, -4, 1)
is_positive <- c( X > 0 )
X[is_positive]
